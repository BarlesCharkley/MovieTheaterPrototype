// Just drag the appropriate Font Texture that every font includes onto a material
// that's set to GUI/3DTextShader. Change the font on the TextMesh to the one you want,
// THEN apply the relevant 3DText material to the TextMesh. You have to create a new
// material for every new font, and you have to change the font color in the material
// instead of the TextMesh, but otherwise it works as normal, except it doesn't show
// through the damn walls.
